# Sparkle-O-Meter
Sparkle, sparkle!

As you know, when you write an essay for your English class, you must **F L A U N T   Y O U R   D I C T I O N.**
The Sparkle-O-Meter will help you finetune your essay to ensure you are correctly **F L A U N T I N G  Y O U R  D I C T I O N.**
Simply copy and paste your essay, and our unique and *totally reliable* algorithm will scan your essay to look for
*P R E C I S E , S O P H I S T I C A T E D D I C T I O N* -- and give you a grade.
...aim for a 100%.

# ...an explanation, please?
The program scans your essay for any of the 1000 most used English words (corpus: https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english)
Then, it grades your essay solely based on the amount of words that are not part of this list. In this way, only *precise, sophisticated diction* will count toward your grade.
The Sparkle-O-Meter is completely reliable and totally is not designed as a satire of my English teacher.

Memes are good for the soul.
